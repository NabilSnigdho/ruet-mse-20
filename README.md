# RUET MSE-20 Family (ruet-mse-20)

An useless app which doesn't do much than showing pictures of my university classmates in a gallery like view and showing their infos upon clicking on pictures. Created this app for fun and trying the amazing [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/). It also uses [MiniSearch](https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/) for searching through the infos. The photos and infos are not uploaded in github for privacy reasons.

## Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn lint
# or
npm run lint
```

### Format the files

```bash
yarn format
# or
npm run format
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration

See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).
